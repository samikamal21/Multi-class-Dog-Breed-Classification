# Multi-class-Dog-Breed-Classification
Developed a multi-class image classifier using a neural network in TensorFlow for a challenging task of dog breed classification.

This notebook builds a multi-class image classifier using a neural network with TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.

## 1. Problem

Identifying the breed of a dog gives an image of a dog.

## 2. Data

The data being used is from [Kaggle's](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification) dog breed identification competition.

## 3. Evaluation

The [evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation) is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

## 4. Features

Some information about the data:
* We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's best to use deep learning/transfer learning.
* There are 120 breeds of dog.
* There are approximately 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).
* There are approximately 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels since we need to predict them).
